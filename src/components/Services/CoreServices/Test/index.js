      <p>
        Dynamic web design is a crucial aspect of modern web development,
        allowing websites to go beyond static content and provide a more
        immersive user experience. Unlike static websites, which display fixed
        content to all users, dynamic websites adapt and respond to user
        interactions, making them more engaging and user-friendly.

        "Dynamic web design is an important part of creating modern websites. It helps websites do more than just show the same unchanging information to everyone. Instead, dynamic websites can change and react based on what users do. This makes them more interesting and easier to use compared to websites that always look the same."

        <li>
          <b>Database Management Systems:</b> Database
          integration is a key component of dynamic web design. Databases

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Single Page Applications (SPAs): </b>SPAs load a single HTML page
          and dynamically update content as the user interacts with the site.
          This provides a smooth, app-like experience without constant page
          reloads.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Frameworks and Libraries (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js): </b>These
          JavaScript frameworks and libraries offer pre-built components and
          functionalities for creating dynamic web applications efficiently.
